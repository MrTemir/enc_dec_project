This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to use the Encryption/Decryption Program in its .exe format. The program allows you to encrypt and decrypt text using various cryptographic algorithms, including Caesar Cipher, Morse Code, HEX, and Affine Cipher.
System Requirements
Operating System: Windows 7 or later.
Java Runtime Environment (JRE): Ensure you have JRE installed on your system. If not, download and install it from Oracle's website.
How to Use the Program
Launch the Program:
Double-click the .exe file to start the program.
A window titled "Encryption/Decryption" will appear.
Choose Function:
In the "Choose function" dropdown menu, select either "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" depending on your needs.
Select Cipher:
In the "Choose cipher" dropdown menu, select one of the following algorithms:
Ceasar: A shift-based cipher.
Morse: Converts text to Morse code or vice versa.
HEX: Converts text to hexadecimal or vice versa.
Affine: A mathematical cipher requiring two keys (a and b).
Enter Input Text:
In the "Input text" field, type or paste the text you want to encrypt or decrypt.
Provide Additional Parameters (if required):
For Ceasar Cipher:
Enter the shift value in the "Shift value" field.
For Affine Cipher:
Enter the values for a and b in their respective fields.
Process the Text:
Click the "Process" button to perform the encryption or decryption.
The result will be displayed in the output text area at the bottom of the window.
Copy or Save the Output:
You can copy the output text directly from the output text area or manually save it to a file.
Examples
Encrypting with Caesar Cipher:
Function: Encrypt
Cipher: Ceasar
Input Text: Hello World
Shift Value: 3
Output: Khoor Zruog
Decrypting with Morse Code:
Function: Decrypt
Cipher: Morse
Input Text: .... . .-.. .-.. --- / .-- --- .-. .-.. -..
Output: HELLO WORLD
Encrypting with Affine Cipher:
Function: Encrypt
Cipher: Affine
Input Text: ABC
Value a: 5
Value b: 8
Output: INS
